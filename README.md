Bash script for Automatic EBS Snapshots and Cleanup on Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Written by  **[AWS Consultants - Casey Labs Inc.] (http://www.caseylabs.com)**

===================================

**How it works:**
ebs-snapshot.sh will:
- Determine the instance ID of the EC2 server on which the script runs
- Gather a list of all volume IDs attached to that instance
- Take a snapshot of each attached volume
- The script will then delete all associated snapshots taken by the script that are older than 7 days

Pull requests greatly welcomed!

===================================

**REQUIREMENTS**

**IAM User:** This script requires that new IAM user credentials be created, with the following IAM security policy attached:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1426256275000",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:CreateSnapshot",
                "ec2:CreateTags",
                "ec2:DeleteSnapshot",
                "ec2:DescribeSnapshots",
                "ec2:DescribeVolumes"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```


```
sudo su -
cd /root

apt-get install python-pip -y
pip install awscli
aws configure

AWS Access Key ID: (Enter in the IAM credentials generated above.)
AWS Secret Access Key: (Enter in the IAM credentials generated above.)
Default region name: (The region that this instance is in: i.e. us-east-1, eu-west-1, etc.)
Default output format: (Enter "text".)```

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sassafrastech/aws-ec2-ebs-automatic-snapshot-bash/master/ebs-snapshot.sh
chmod +x ebs-snapshot.sh

# Manual test
SNAPSHOT_NAME_PREFIX=foo ./ebs-snapshot.sh
```

You should then setup a cron job in order to schedule a nightly backup. Example crontab jobs:
```
0 3 * * * AWS_CONFIG_FILE="/root/.aws/config" RETAIN_DAY_OF_WEEK=4 SNAPSHOT_NAME_PREFIX=foo /root/ebs-snapshot.sh
```
